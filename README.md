## 🎯 What I Do

I specialize in developing internal tools that help agencies scale their operations without scaling headcount. Think semantic analysis for internal linking, no-code data visualization widgets, and content migration utilities—all built with **TypeScript** and designed for real-world agency use cases.

**Core competencies:**
- **Custom SEO Utilities:** Building high-performance, client-side analysis tools.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating interactive, embeddable widgets for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Workflow Automation:** Streamlining repetitive SEO and content tasks to save hundreds of hours.
- **Branded Deliverables:** Developing polished, technical tools that agencies can offer as premium services.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C++ (DSP focus)
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Web APIs
- **Architecture:** Modular, type-safe development for complex client-side logic
- **Design:** Modern, technical aesthetics (Analog/Neo-brutalist influence)
